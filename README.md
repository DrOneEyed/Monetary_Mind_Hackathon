Personal Loan: -
One of the financial products that you can avail for yourself is a personal loan. You can avail a personal loan to meet your various financial requirements. There are various banks in India who offer best personal loans to their customers and you can easily apply for it either online or offline. However, before you avail a personal loan, you must check the interest rates offered by different banks which varies between 7.90% p.a. and 49% p.a.
Factors that Affect Personal Loan Interest Rates
Income: Loan providers take the applicant’s income into account when deciding the interest rate. Individuals who have a high income pose a lower risk to the bank and, thus, might be offered a lower interest rate. On the other hand, those with lower annual incomes may have to pay a higher interest rate.
Employer Details: If you work for a reputed organization, the bank/financial institution is more likely to offer you a lower rate of interest.
Nature of the Employment: Loan providers may offer different interest rates to applicants based on whether they are self-employed or salaried.
Age: The age of the applicant can also have an impact on the interest rate quoted by the loan provider. Individuals who are nearing the retirement age may be charged a higher interest rate.
Relationship with the Loan Provider: Existing customers of the bank/financial institution may be offered a lower rate of interest at the time of applying for a personal loan, provided they have a good relationship with the loan provider. This is, however, at the discretion of the bank and not all existing customers will be offered a preferential interest rate.

A working capital loan is a loan taken to finance a company's everyday operations.
Working capital loans are not used to buy long-term assets or investments; they are used to provide working capital to covers a company's short-term operational needs.
Companies with high seasonality or cyclical sales may rely on working capital loans to help with periods of reduced business activity.
Working capital loans are often tied to a business owner's personal credit, so missed payments or defaults may hurt their credit score.

Term Loan: -
A term loan is a simply a loan that is given for a fixed duration of time and must be repaid in regular instalments. These loans usually extended for a longer duration of time which may range from 1 year to 10 or 30 years. Rate of interest charged under these loans may be on a fixed or floating basis, which will vary with market fluctuations. Term loans are mostly used as small business loans but can also be taken on an individual basis as well.
Features of Term Loan
The features of term loans are as follows:
Term loans are Secured Loans. The asset that is purchased using the term loan amount, will serve as a primary security and other assets of the company will be serving as collateral security.
The loan has to be repaid within the fixed term regardless of the firm’s financial situation.
The interest rate on the loan is charged after evaluating the credit risk of the proposal, the loan amount and tenure for which the loan is taken. The interest rate will be subject to a minimum lending rate. The rate is negotiated between borrowers and lenders at the time of distributing the loan.
The term loan’s maturity lies between 5 -10 years. The repayment of the loan is made in instalments. The tenure can be rescheduled to help borrowers deal with the financial emergencies.
The lender will ask the borrower not to raise additional loans and to repay the existing loans and maintain a minimum asset base.
Term loans can be converted into equity according to the terms and conditions that have been laid out by the lender.
Financial institutions impose a penalty on the defaults.
Commitment fee is charged on the unutilized loan amount.
The principal loan amount is to be repaid after the initial grace period of 1 – 2 years.
Commercial banks’ term loan are repayable in equal quarterly instalments whereas financial institutions’ term loan are repayable in equal semi-annual instalments.
Servicing burden of the loan declines over time. The interest will be less and the principal repayment will remain constant.

Bill Discounting: - 
Bill Discounting is short-term finance for traders wherein they can sell unpaid invoices, due on a future date, to financial institutions in lieu of a commission. The Bank purchases the bill (Promissory Note) before its due date and credits the bill’s value after a discount charge to the customer’s account.  The Bank will realise the bill amount on the bill’s due date directly from the debtor. This helps the traders optimise their cash flows and business (payment) cycles without disturbing their balance sheets. Lenders usually offer tenors of up to 180 days while offering bill discounting facilities.
Bill Discounting Process
Below described are the steps involved in the process of Bill Discounting:
MSMEs, as well as supply chain finance entities, raise invoices against larger corporates for the goods supplied or services offered.
To monetise their unpaid bills, enterprises can bring their invoices for invoice discounting to lenders
Within a few working days, the submitted invoices are converted into cash and transferred to MSMEs at discounted rates
SMEs complete multiple business cycles in this tenure upon the release of payment from corporates
Factors affecting the Discount Rates
The discount rates offered by lenders on bill discounting shall depend on various factors, such as financial history, business tenure, business stability, business volume, your CIBIL score, and creditworthiness.

Account aggregation sometimes also known as financial data aggregation is a method that involves compiling information from different accounts, which may include bank accounts, credit card accounts, investment accounts, and other consumer or business accounts, into a single place. This may be provided through connecting via an API to the financial institution or provided through "screen scraping" where a user provides the requisite account-access information for an automated system to gather and compile the information into a single page. The security of the account access details as well as the financial information is key to users having confidence in the service.

Future:-
To put it simply, account aggregators enable users to link their financial accounts, aggregating all financial details of the user in one place for easy access
Banking data acquired via the account aggregators work on pain points like the authenticity of the data, skipping OCR aiding financial information users — mostly lending firms
But besides lending, the feature will also aid companies and users across fintech, direct and indirect taxation, insurance, personal finance and open finance
Future Scope:
We have planned to make the application interface a more user friendly one in future.
We will add options for the Customer to choose between different types of banks for the loan.
We will add options for customers to apply for loans directly through our application.
We will add more options for more types of loans and allow people to apply for credit.
We have plans to do Primary Documentation and E-KYC.
